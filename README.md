# GABOT - A bot from nowhere

> ## We are lazy and selfish creature, so we need one who isn't. Which is _almost_ impossible.

This bot born based on that reason, where most of our problems are the cause of our laziness and selfishness. We tend to forget things, but what much worse is, when one who remember doesn't tell the other despite the one is assumming that the other already remember. It's not happen all the time, though. Gabot is here to give a little help and regardless of its imperfection, gabot would try its best to prevent you being forgetful.

### Group Reminder

The very first thing that came to mind when started to build this bot was _"What if I could make something that could remind all group member voluntarily?"_ then this bot started to born with it's only feature, **"Group reminder"**.

### Personal Reminder

With a glorious joy after being succeeded to build one feature, a light bulb popped up from one's mind _"Hey, what if I put this feature for personal use?"_. After a few lines, the bot had gained new ability, **"Personal reminder"**.

### Find NRP (or Member's ID) And Fullname

Knowing the bot had become clever, one challenged himself to build more features. _"I could make it to recognize every member of this group, it would be great."_. More lines of code had been typed, more time had been spent to teach the bot one or two lessons. After a few day pass, the result didn't betray one's effort. The bot started to recognize the group's member name and ID. Gabot had learned to **"Find member's ID and fullname"**

### Schedule

He didn't stop, craving for more challenging feature. _"We had problem to remember our schedule, I think this thing could help"_. He started to make a list of problems he wanted to solve. Working tirelessly to cross every list and built something he really wanted to exist. But this time, he failed. Not once, many times, then gave up.

Yet a few weeks later, he decided to do it right. Not long after, the new feature had finally released. **"Make schedule"**
